# Additional Features

## Leaderboard 

After completing a FoxTale, you can view the Leaderboard. It shows the first 5 players that won. You must be signed into Farcaster when playing to get on the Leaderboard. It pays to be quick! 

## Minting

Each FoxTale can be minted. After winning, you can click to Mint with Warps right inside the Warpcast feed. If you have a Warps balance on Warpcast, you will be able to mint. The NFTs are minted on Base. [Here is an example FoxTale NFT image.](https://foxtales.vercel.app/api/img/2)

In the future it will be possible to mint the NFTs on the web and on other chains, but for now, the only option that is supported is Mint with Warps. 

## MetaMask Snap

You can install the [FoxTales Snap for MetaMask](https://montoya.github.io/foxtales-snap/) to view the latest FoxTales that are published by the community. The Snap displays the most recent 10 FoxTales with links to cast and play them on Warpcast.
