# Additional Features

## Leaderboard 

After completing a FoxTale, you can view the Leaderboard. It shows the first 5 players that won. You must be signed into Farcaster when playing to get on the Leaderboard. It pays to be quick! 

## Minting

Each FoxTale can be minted. After winning, you can click Mint to mint the tale for free. The NFTs are minted on Base to your connected Ethereum address (or your Farcaster address if you have not connected an address) and the gas is sponsored. [Here is an example FoxTale NFT image.](https://foxtales.vercel.app/api/img/2)

In the future it may be possible to mint on other chains, but for now only Base is supported.

_If the minting wallet runs out of ETH to cover gas, please let us know and we will top it up._

## MetaMask Snap

You can install the [FoxTales Snap for MetaMask Flask](https://montoya.github.io/foxtales-snap/) to view the latest FoxTales that are published by the community. The Snap displays the most recent 10 FoxTales with links to cast and play them on Warpcast. It only works with MetaMask Flask for now &mdash; soon it will be compatible with MetaMask Extension too. 

## Sandbox

If you really like JSON, you can view the format and even try hand-editing with the [FoxTales Sandbox](https://montoya.github.io/foxtales-sandbox/). This format is the same format used for all tales made with the FoxTales Studio. The web player used in the sandbox can be deployed anywhere to support embedded FoxTales.
