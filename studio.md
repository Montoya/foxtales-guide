# The Studio

Every writer deserves great tools. Even you! You can get started writing your own stories with the [FoxTales Studio](https://foxtales.vercel.app). 

To use the Studio, you will need to sign into Farcaster. This will only read from your Farcaster account. It will not have permission to write to Farcaster. 

After signing in, you will be greeted with the editor interface where you can make your own FoxTales. The editor is preloaded with the simplest possible example of a FoxTale and a simulator to play it. This is a good way to start learning how to make your own FoxTales. You can load more examples, each one a bit more complex than the last, by clicking "Load" and choosing from the available examples. The more complex examples will teach you how to use items, hints, and codes. You can try editing each example to get the hang of it. 

The basic editing flow is like this: you add pages, then add "gotos" which are the links between pages. Specific pages that are the endings to your story can have a "win" or "lose" condition. You can make basic adventure stories with just these features, then explore more complex features like items and codes later on. 

## Publishing 

Once you have a FoxTale you like, and you have verified that it is playable in the simulator, you can Publish it! Publishing will save the FoxTale to a database &mdash; it does not post the tale to your feed! To do that, after publishing or saving your tale, click the Share button. 

Now that you know how to make your own FoxTales, you are ready to learn about [additional features](features.md) like leaderboards and minting.
