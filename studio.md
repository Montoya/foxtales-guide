# The Studio

Every writer deserves great tools. Even you! You can get started writing your own stories with the [FoxTales Studio](https://foxtales.vercel.app). 

To use the Studio, you will need to sign into your Farcaster account. The Studio uses Neynar, which should provide sign-in functionality for free. If you are asked to pay warps to connect, please reach out to Christian Montoya for assistance. 

After signing in, you will be greeted with the editor interface where you can make your own FoxTales. The editor is preloaded with the simplest possible example of a FoxTale and a simulator to play it. This is a good way to start learning how to make your own FoxTales. You can load more examples, each one a bit more complex than the last, by clicking "Load" and choosing from the available examples. The more complex examples will teach you how to use items, hints, and codes. You can try editing each example to get the hang of it. 

## Publishing 

Once you have a FoxTale you like, and you have verified that it is playable in the simulator, you can Publish it! Publishing will save the FoxTale to a database &mdash; it does not post the tale to your feed! If you want to post it to your feed, you can click Share, but we ask that you do not cast any tales until the project goes live later this week. 

Now that you know how to make your own FoxTales, you are ready to learn about [additional features](features.md) like leaderboards and minting.
