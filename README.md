# Secret Writers' Club

This guide will help you start writing your own interactive stories. First, a ground rule: we do not talk about the Secret Writers' Club &mdash; it's a secret! Do not share or cast any URLs until the Secret Writers' Club is closed. Your discretion will be greatly appreciated. 

Now, let's start learning...

## What is an interactive story? 

Interactive stories are stories with branching paths. Depending on the choices the reader makes, they will get different outcomes. They can experience the story multiple times to try different paths and find all the outcomes. 

- These interactive stories have one or more **win** and **lose** conditions. 
- The way a reader gets from one page to another is by following a **goto**. 

Each page has up to 256 characters of text, and each **goto** has a label with up to 16 characters of text. 

But wait, there's more! In the Secret Writers' Club, you will have access to some advanced features: 

- Readers can acquire **items** which are represented by :sparkles: emoji :sparkles:.
- As they progress through a story, they can see their **inventory** of acquired items.
- Certain actions, like following a **goto** or acquiring an **item**, can **require** one or more items in order to be performed. 
- These requirements can have hints which guide the reader to be aware of the **items** they need.
- Actions can also require entering secret **codes**.

## How will I write interactive stories? 

If you like hand-editing JavaScript Object Notation, you should seek help. For the rest of you, there's the [Studio](studio.md): a visual editor where you can create your pages, conditions, and actions to build your interactive story.
